# Angular2 Rollup Seed

Yet another Angular2 seed, but this one based on Rollup and BrowserSync.

***Note*** First initial load takes some time so vendor files are generated. 
Then it runs like a charm with incremental builds which takes about 60ms-100ms.

## Usage

### Install

First, clone this repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jkuri/angular2-rollup-starter.git
```

Move into cloned directory and run 

```sh
npm install
```

### Serve

```sh
npm run serve
```

This command serves your app with live-reload enabled.

### Production Build

```sh
npm run roll
```
